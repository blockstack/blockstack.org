Blockstack is a new internet for decentralized apps. Our open-source community of 13,775 members globally is building protocols & tools that make it easy to build scalable decentralized apps.

Blockstack PBC, a Public Benefit Corp, was co-founded by Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali to contribute to the development of the core open-source software. Blockstack PBC has offices in New York City, San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Toronto.

Blockstack PBC raised a $4M Series A in January 2017, and $50M in the Blockstack Token Sale in December 2017. We are grateful to have investors like Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital, Naval Ravikant, Winklevoss Capital, Digital Currency Group, Foundation Capital, Kevin Rose, and Michael Arrington amongst others. Our token sale had 800 Accredited Investors and 8000+ total participants.

## Mission

Blockstack’s mission is to enable an open, decentralized internet which will benefit all internet users by giving them more control over information and computation. We’re committed to always support the decentralization of the Blockstack network and ensure that we build the network in a way that no single entity, including Blockstack PBC, has control over it.

# Blockstack Values

Blockstack is an open-source project with core developers and contributors located around the world, from New York City to Hong Kong. We believe the community is one of our greatest assets, and the team engages with users via Slack, Github, Twitter, and the Blockstack Forum in order to build the best product possible.

We get a lot of applicants, and have historically hired people who are proactively involved in our work and mission of decentralizing the internet. Even a simple pull request goes a long way in signaling interest in the project. We hope you explore our Github, Whitepaper, Browser, and Slack prior to submitting your resume.
