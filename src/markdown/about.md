## In Short
Blockstack is a new internet for decentralized apps that you access through the Blockstack Browser. With Blockstack, there is a new world of apps that let you own your data and maintain your privacy, security and freedom.

## How It Works
Blockstack uses the lower layers of the traditional internet and focuses on decentralizing the application layer. Blockstack provides key tools and infrastructure to developers enabling decentralized storage and decentralized authentication & identity. Developers build single-page applications in JavaScript then plug into user-run APIs, which eliminates centralized points of control. Users run decentralized apps through the Blockstack browser and give explicit read/write permissions to their data. Information is encrypted and stored on usersâ€™ personal devices. There are no middlemen, no passwords, and no massive data silos to breach.

Get started by installing the [Blockstack Browser](https://blockstack.org/install) (available for Mac, Windows, and Linux).

There are many Blockstack apps already in production and more being built every day with the participation of the online open source community and in partnership with VC Bounties Programs. See more on that at (blockstack.org/funding)

## Stats

## Blockstack is a Public Benefit Corp
Blockstack is both an open source project and a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). Blockstack PBC, a Public Benefit Corp, upholds specific commitments to the greater public good in addition to stockholder interests. The mission of Blockstack PBC is to enable an open, decentralized internet. Blockstack PBC is committed to always keep the core Blockstack software open-source, and to support the decentralization of the Blockstack network. Blockstack PBC has historically taken the lead on Blockstack protocol development, but in the future will work with other parties to build a fully transparent and adaptable decentralized internet.

## History
Blockstack was started by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea in 2013. The first public launch of a registrar service (called the Onename App) was in March 2014 and the company went through Y Combinator in summer 2014. After YC, the company raised a Seed round led by Union Square Ventures. The company closed a Series A in January 2017, again led by Union Square Ventures, with investors including Lux Capital, Naval Ravikant, and Shana Fisher. Blockstack became a Public Benefit Corp in September 2017.

## Blockstack Values
