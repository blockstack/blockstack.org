Blockstack is decentralized DNS. It gives you fast, secure, and easy-to-use DNS, PKI, and identity management on the blockchain.

With the Blockstack software, a network of computers collectively maintain a global registry of names.

When you run a Blockstack node, you join this network, which is more secure by design than traditional DNS
or naming systems. This is because the system's registry and its records are secured by an underlying blockchain, which is extremely resilient against tampering and control.

In the Blockstack's registry, each of the names has an owner, represented by a cryptographic keypair, and is associated with instructions for how DNS resolvers and other software should resolve the name.

Blockstack provides:

- name lookups on a decentralized naming system
- name registrations and transfers without centralized registrars
- automatic binding of names to owning cryptographic keypairs
- automatic cache invalidation
- immunity to DNS cache poisoning
- robust certificate pinning capabilities
- resistance to censorship of name registration and resolution
