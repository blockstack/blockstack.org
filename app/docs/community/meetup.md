# Host a Blockstack Meetup in your city

Here you can find the process for hosting a meetup in your city

## Getting Started

### Create meetup group 
First step is going to meetup.com and creating a group and title it "Blockstack [insert_your_city]" and establish yourself as the organizer. Alert @pstan26 in the issues of this repo and he'll join to be added as a co-organizer. If your country uses Facebook more often for things like this, feel free to create a facebook group.

### Meetup Description
Here's some sample copy you can use for the meetup description:

The decentralized internet on [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/) is powered by a technological breakthrough in consensus algorithms which allows you to take back your rights to ownership, privacy, and safety and to experience the internet as it was truly meant to be.

As a developer, you can build decentralized apps without having to set up any infrastructure or worry about hosting user data. The decentralized Blockstack network handles identity, auth, storage, and replaces DNS and TLS.

This meetup is all about building apps on the decentralized internet on Blockstack.

Blockstack is an open source project with over thousands of meetup members worldwide. Learn more about what Blockstack [here](https://blockstack.org/intro).

Add "blockstack" as one of the topic tags for this meetup.

### Meetup Group Settings
It is recommended that you enable links to Blockstack in your group's settings.  To do this navigate to Group Tools >> Group Settings >> Optional Features.  In the "Follow us on..." section check the box for Twitter and enter "BlockstackOrg".  Check the "Other site" checkbox and enter "http://chat.blockstack.org/"

### Picking your location and time
Finally get your first meetup scheduled with a location that can seat at least 30 people and we'll have a Blockstack Core team member visit or video in to present material. Create an issue in this repo tagging @pstan26 when you have found a date and location and we'll coordinate with you. Blockstack Org is happy to contribute to pizza and beverages.


### Planning your very first meetup
Typically its smart to start with an intro to Blockstack for the first meetup where we will have a presence whether via videochat or in person. In the first meetup we'll cover:

- Problems with the legacy internet
- A vision for a the decentralized internet
- Demo the Blockstack Browser
- Show how to build fully decentralized apps with storage on Blockstack

In the intro email you can encourage them to watch the video on [building decentralized single page javascript apps on blockstack](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/js-monthly-london/decentralizing-the-internet-with-serverless-single-page-javascript-apps) and a good video to share is Tim Berners-Lee [explaining](https://charlierose.com/videos/29038) the exact same vision.

If they plan to get aquianted with the system and want to not get hung up anywhere, suggest to them the [Hello Blockstack Tutorial](https://blockstack.org/tutorials/hello-blockstack), which will require them to use npm, browserify, and blockstack.js.

### Become a Blockstack Evangelist

Blockstack Evangelists are Blockstack experts and leaders in their communities who demonstrate a commitment to sharing their Blockstack knowledge with others. Members of the program are actively publishing blog posts, speaking at industry events, developing training materials, and involved with local meetups. Blockstack Evangelists are nominated as candidates for the program by the Blockstack team based on their exemplary contributions to and outstanding engagement with the Blockstack community. 

Blockstack Evangelists are eager to bring their technical expertise to new audiences both offline and online around the world.
