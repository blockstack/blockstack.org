*Blockstack Storage and Atlas Network Whitepaper*

At Blockstack, we’ve been (quietly) building a new internet that has been running in production for over 3 years now. Our design removes any trust points from the middle of the network. This internet allows for true decentralization, as envisioned by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf.

We’ve been refining the design of our blockchain, peer network, and storage over the last years of production experience and today, we’re excited to announce the details of these systems in a [Blockstack whitepaper](***Insert_URL-here***).

*Decentralized Summer*

The core team is proud to announce a new developer program, "Blockstack's Decentralized Summer", running from June 1st to August 31st. The focus is on building decentralized applications that use identity, storage, and payments on the decentralized internet powered by Blockstack.

During this time you will build one of the first ten apps, like a decentralized twitter, uber, or voting system, that will be featured to over 70,000 decentralized app users. The Blockstack core team will work with you step-by-step via slack and weekly check-ins while you'll receive $6,000/mo. If you or someone you know is interested, visit [the Decentralized Summer page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockstacks-decentralized-summer-tickets-34395687427).

*Tor Integration*

Blockstack now has the ability to resolve Tor hidden services using human-readable names. For example, instead of going to `3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion`, users can go to `duckduckgo_tor.id` to get to DuckDuckGo.

We have released a proof-of-concept here: https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-tor

*New Blockstack Meetups*

Say hello to brand new meetup groups: [Blockstack Cuba](https://www.meetup.com/Blockstack-cuba/), run by organizer Olemis Lang, and [Blockstack Portland](https://www.meetup.com/Blockstack-Portland/), organized by Dan Trevino. The core team is looking forward to visiting both locations for their inaugural meetups!
