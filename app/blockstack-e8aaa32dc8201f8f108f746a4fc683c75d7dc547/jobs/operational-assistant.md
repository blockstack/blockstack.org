### Blockstack:

Blockstack is building a new decentralized internet where users control their data and apps run without remote servers. Developers build apps on our full stack platform and users download our browser portal to access the decentralized internet and get started.

On the traditional internet, we’re highly dependent on third parties, our data is vulnerable, and power and profits consolidate within the hands of a few. With the decentralized internet on Blockstack, data and power is in the hand of the end users and everyday developers.

Blockstack is a global, open source community with over 2,500 developers and over 70,000 users. It was co-founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea in 2013 at Princeton and the core team is based in New York City and Hong Kong.

We recently raised a $4M Series A and are grateful to have the confidence of investors like Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital, Shana Fisher, and Naval Ravikant.

### More about us:

- We’re located in the lovely NoHo district of Manhattan.
- We’re both an open source project and a startup, so transparency is important to us.
- We’re passionate about making the internet freer and safer for everyone and you should be, too.
