                      Blockstack is a new internet for decentralized apps that you access through 
                      the <a href="/install">Blockstack Browser</a>. With Blockstack, there is a 
                      new world of apps that let you own your data and maintain your privacy, 
                      security and freedom.

                      How It Works
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Blockstack uses the lower layers of the traditional internet and focuses on 
                      decentralizing the application layer. Blockstack provides key tools and 
                      infrastructure to developers enabling decentralized storage and decentralized 
                      authentication & identity. Developers build single-page applications in 
                      Javascript then plug into user-run APIs, which eliminates centralized points 
                      of control. Users run decentralized apps through the Blockstack browser and 
                      give explicit read/write permissions to their data. Information is encrypted 
                      and stored on usersâ€™ personal devices. There are no middlemen, no passwords, 
                      and no massive data silos to breach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Get started by installing the <a href="/install">Blockstack Browser
                      </a> (available for Mac, Windows, and Linux).

                    <p className="mb-5">
                      There are many Blockstack apps already in production and more being built 
                      every day with the participation of the online open source community and in 
                      partnership with VC Bounties Programs. See more on that at <a href="/funding">

                        The mission of Blockstack PBC is to enable an open, decentralized internet. 
                        Blockstack PBC is committed to always keep the core Blockstack software 
                        open-source, and to support the decentralization of the Blockstack network. 
                        Blockstack PBC has historically taken the lead on Blockstack protocol 
                        development, but in the future will work with other parties to build a 
                        fully transparent and adaptable decentralized internet.

                      <p className="mb-5">
                        Blockstack was started by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea in 2013. The first public 
                        launch of a registrar service (called the Onename App) was in March 2014 and 
                        the company went through Y Combinator in summer 2014. After YC, the company 
                        raised a Seed round led by Union Square Ventures. The company closed a Series 
                        A in January 2017, again led by Union Square Ventures, with investors including 
                        Lux Capital, Naval Ravikant, and Shana Fisher. Blockstack became a Public 
                        Benefit Corp in September 2017.
