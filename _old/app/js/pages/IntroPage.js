              Blockstack is a new decentralized internet.
            </p>

            <p>
              With Blockstack, users control their data and apps run on their devices.
              There are no middlemen, no passwords, no massive data silos to breach,
              and no services tracking us around the internet.
            </p>

            <p>
              The applications on blockstack are server-less and decentralized.

              Developers start by building a single-page application in JavaScript,

              Then, instead of plugging the frontend into a centralized API,
              they plug into an API run by the user.

              Developers install a library called 'blockstack.js' and
              don't have to worry about running servers, maintaining databases,
              or building out user management systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Personal user APIs ship with the Blockstack app and
              handle everything from identity and authentication
              to data storage.

              Applications can request permissions from users and then
              gain read and write access to user resources.
            </p>

            <p>
              Data storage is simple and reliable and uses existing cloud infrastructure.

              Users connect with their Dropbox, Google Drive, etc and data is synced from
              their local device up to the cloud.
            </p>

            <p>
              Identity is user-controlled and utilizes the blockchain for secure management
              of keys, devices and usernames.

              When users login with apps, they are anonymous by default and use an
              app-specific key, but their full identity can be revealed and proven
              at any time.

              Keys are for signing and encryption and can be changed
              as devices need to be added or removed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Under the hood, Blockstack provides a decentralized domain name system (DNS),
              decentralized public key distribution system,
              and registry for apps and user identities.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's a diagram laying out the major components of Blockstack and showing how it works under the hood:
