## Technology

This is a react application built using [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). It is statically exported to markup + javascript. It is using [redux-bundler]() (an abstraction on top of redux + reselect) for state management. _Most_ of the content is written in Markdown, parsed using [`MDX`]().

## Contributing

Be sure to have node + npm/yarn installed before getting started.

Fork the repo and pull it down to your machine, and then in the directory run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

OR

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Running the `dev` task will launch a local instance of the site with all the modern advantages of front end work (hot module reloading, etc).

### Adding pages / routes

Next.js is first and foremost a directory/file based framework. If you look in the `pages` directory, you should get a pretty good idea of the routes contained within this project. To add a new route, simply create a file or folder with the route you want to add, and start coding! Files can be `*.js` or `*.mdx`

The blog gets its data from an external source (Ghost) and is parsed via `/blog` and `/blog/single`. Even though the data is external, you can still get some insight into how the routes work via the directory structure.

#### Exporting new pages

Because we are exporting the react application to run in places only static sites can, we have to pass our routes to the `next.config.js` file. We have a [`routes.js`](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.org/blob/master/routes.js) file that contains our static and dynamic routes. When adding a new page, make sure to add the path to this file.

Next.js has a function called `exportPathMap` in the `next.config.js` which allows the export to know what to export! You can also fetch data at this point to generate dynamic pages. Take a look at [`next.config.js`](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.org/blob/master/next.config.js) to see an example.
